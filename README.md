This is my first program I'm working on.  Please be patient...

Summary: Rename files with unwanted characters!

Details:
I hate downloading files that have spaces, brackets, or other junk characters in the names; spaces are the worst.
So I'm re-writing a tool I wrote before but going to make it out of python and take it to the next level.
